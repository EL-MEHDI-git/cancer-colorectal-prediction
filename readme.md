# Cancer Colorectal Prediction - Machine Learning Models

## Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for my two-month internship project in 2021, where I worked on predictive analysis in patients with colorectal cancer. The main objective of the project was to develop machine learning models for predicting complications during surgery. The project involved feature engineering, descriptive and predictive analysis of colorectal cancer, and the development of a graphical user interface.

## Project Description
The project focuses on developing machine learning models for predicting complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The project's main tasks included data preparation, cleaning, and visualization, feature engineering (dimensionality reduction), and developing predictive models. Additionally, a graphical user interface was created to enhance the usability of the models.

## Features
The project includes the following features:

Data preparation, cleaning, and visualization
Feature engineering (dimensionality reduction)
Development of predictive models for surgical complications
Creation of a graphical user interface


## Notebooks
The project involved experimenting with various techniques, which can be found in the notebook Features_Engineering [All_techniques_tried].ipynb. The final version of the project can be found in the notebook ACP + VotingClassifier.ipynb.
